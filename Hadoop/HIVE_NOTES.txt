1. if you are creating a table of columns with some precision , say varchar(20) or char(10). And if you try to insert a value which is greater than this precision,
	still the value will be getting inserted , but will be trimmed to the precision.
2.if in substr(<input string>,p,n) , even if you mention any p or n (integer only) which is not relevant in context of position or lentgh , it won't throw error but 
will return an empty string
3. index(split(<column>,<delimitter>),n), here if n>=length of the list, then it will return  NULL
4. To use position in order by or group by , you need to update hive.groupby.orderby.position.alias=True first in Hive
5. While running a Hive QL we need to be sure about following

In order to change the average load for a reducer (in bytes):
  set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=<number>
In order to limit the maximum number of reducers:
  set hive.exec.reducers.max=<number>
In order to set a constant number of reducers:
  set mapreduce.job.reduces=<number>
