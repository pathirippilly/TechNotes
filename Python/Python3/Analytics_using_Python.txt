Structure of generic filter,map and reduce is as below:

def myFilter(c,f):
    newC=[]
    for i in c:
        if f(i):
            newC.append(i)
    return newC
	
def myMapper(c,f):
    newC=[]
    for i in c:
        newC.append(f(i))
    return newC
	
def myReducer(c,f):
    t = c[0]
    for i in c[1:]:
        t=f(t,i)
    return t
