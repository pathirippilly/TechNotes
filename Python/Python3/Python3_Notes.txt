1. In Python3 print is a function while in python2 its a statement
2. In Python3 integer division still gives you float while in python2 it gives only integer
1/2 = 0.5 in python3
1/2 = 0 in python2, instead you need to use 1/2.0

Integer division in Python3 is achieved by '//'

eg:
1//2 = 0 in python3

3. In Python3 map and filter returns respective objects  which is not iterable  while in Python2 they returns list 

itertools
*********
groupby(iterable,key)
	:
	sub-iterators grouped by value of key(v)

This will return a iterable groupby object
each element is tuple with key as first element and iterable grouper object as second element
elements of iterable grouper object are nothing but elements of the input iterable, having this key in it

filterfalse(predicate,sequenece):

This will return all elements from sequence untill predicate is false
OR
elements of sequence where predicate is false

predicate is usually a lambda function with some condition 
Syntax  looks similar to filter() but exactly opposite in functioning

starmap(func, seq):
The starmap tool will create an iterator that can compute using the function and iterable provided. As the documentation mentions, 
â€œthe difference between map() and starmap() parallels the distinction between function(a,b) and function(*c).

example:
def add(a, b):
	return a+b

for item in starmap(add, [(2,3), (4,5)]):
	print(item)
